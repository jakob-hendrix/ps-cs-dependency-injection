# Getting Started with Dependency Injection in .NET

The Pluralsight course on C# Dependency Injection.

## Description of DI

A set of software design principles and patterns that enable to develop *loosely coupled code*.

* easy to extend
* easy to test
* easy to maintain
* facilitates parallel development
* facilitate late binding (descisions made at runtime rather than compile-time)

### SOLID prinicples

* S: single-responsibility
* O: open/closed
* L: liskov's substitution princople
* I: interface segrgation principle
* D: dependency inversion principle

### Good Patterns with DI

* **constructor injeciton**
* **property injection**
* method injection
* ambient context
* service locator

### Popular Containers

* **Autofac**
* **Ninject**
* Unity
* Castle Widnsor
* Spring.NET
